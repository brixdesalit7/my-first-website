                <p>This metal tower with three floors stands in the city centre of Paris. It was built for the 1889
                     World Fair (Universal Expo) to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.</p>
                
                <p>The 324metres/1062ft high Eiffel Tower was constructed by Auguste Eiffel and a team of engineers. 
                    If you would like to take the steps up to the tower viewing platform on the second floor, there are 
                    704 steps to climb, but luckily there are also lifts in each of the leg up to the second floor.</p>

                <p>The tower has been visited by over 250 million people since its opening and in 2016 more than 7 million 
                    visitors were welcomed on the tower's top platform! More info about the Eiffel Tower and facts for

                <p>The Great Wall is one of the seven wonders of the world. It runs in sections over a very long distance
                     across China.</p>
                
                <p>The wall is also referred to as ‘Long Wall’ as it is over 21,196 km/13,171 miles long. It was built with
                     stones, bricks and tiles, earth as well as of wooden material. The wall was completed in 1644, but it 
                     took more than 2,000 years to build.</p>
           
                <p>There are more than 20,000 watchtowers along the wall as it was built to protect the country against 
                    invasions from nomads and enemies and to make it easier to collect duty for goods that were transported
                     along the Silk Road.</p>
                
                <p>Today the wall is the most popular tourist attraction in China with more than 10 million visitors per
                     year. Contrary to popular belief the Great Wall cannot be seen from the moon! </p>

                <p>The Kremlin is a fortress with enclosing walls and is built along the Moskva River. The name ‘Kremlin’
                     means ‘fortress within a city’. The more than 500-year-old Kremlin includes the wall with its 20 
                     towers as well as four churches and five palaces within the walls.</p>
                
                <p>The Kremlin was once the residence of the Tzars. Today, it is where the Russian president resides. 
                    The Cathedral of Vasily the Blessed, usually refered to as Saint Basil’s Cathedral, is easily
                     recognised due to its nine brightly coloured onion domes. </p>

                <h1>Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy</h1>
                <p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of Italy’s major tourist attractions. The freestanding bell tower of 
                    the Pisa Cathedral was built over almost two hundred years and was finished in 1399.</p>
                
                <p>The original hight of the tower was 60 meters/196ft, but as it is leaning, the lowest side is now less than
                     56 meters/184ft. The construction already caused many problems as the soil was soft, sandy and unstable. 
                     Already during construction, the builders tried to balance the leaning side with more columns on the
                     other side, but the tower still leaned - like many other buildings in the area.</p>
                
                <p>In 2000, the tower was strengthened by putting stronger soil underneath the tower. You can walk up the 
                    251 stairs to the viewing platform at the top of the tower which is quite an amazing experience. And
                     of course take a picture of you from the lawns next to the tower to 'hold' the tower.</p>

                    near Cairo which is the capital of Egypt.</p>
              <p>The Egyptian pyramids were built during a time when there was only manual labour and no machine lifting
                   equipment available. The pyramids were build to house the bodies of the pharaoh who ruled in ancient
                    Egypt. Next to the Giza pyramids there is the Sphinx, the famous monument of a lion body with a 
                    pharaoh’s head.</p>

                <p>Machu Picchu which means ‘Old Mountain’ in the local Quechua language is a famous site in Peru. It is 
                    also referred to as 'The Lost City of the Incas'.</p>
                
                <p>The ruins of the Lost City are located in the mountains, at more than 2,400 metres/8,000 feet above sea.
                    This ruin site has more than 200 different buildings and structures. The ruins were never discovered by 
                    the European conquistadors but only became known in 1911 when an American archeologist was led to the site
                     by locals.</p>
                
                <p>While some people believe that Machu Picchu was built as a sacred site, others think it once was the 
                    summer retreat of an Inca emperor.  It was built during the 14th century and probably more than 1,000
                     people lived there. As the site is build on a mountain ridge and thus always would be in danger of 
                     sliding down the slope during rainy season, over 600 terraces and a well laid-out drainage 
                      were built around the city.</p>
                
                <p>The city is a magical sight and a great example of Inca engineering, as the structures and buildings of the city were also built without using wheels!</p>
